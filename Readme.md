# HyperNEAT substrate configuration

This university project explores the HyperNEAT algorithm and substrate configuration for a directed locomotion task in Brax. The motivation is to find the link between subtrate dimensionality and performance and test automation of the substrate configuration process through dimensionality reduction techniques.
